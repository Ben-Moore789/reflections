1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	When you are doing a lot of collaboration with others or not always using the same machine.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	It allows control of the changes.  What , when and why.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Fork: A clone on GitHub of someone elses repository, linked back to theirs.  Used when you want to 
		make changes or edits without affeting the orignal, yet still give redit to the orinator.
	Clone: A copy of a repository.  Use when you want to make edits and go forth starting a new path.
	Branch: A subdivision of a repository used to make changes while leaving the original functioning repo intact.
		Use this to experiment or make changes without affecting the original file, with the option of merging them later.

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	You can see differences when you are not connected to the internet.
